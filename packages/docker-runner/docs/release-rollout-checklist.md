# Runner release rollout checklist

Scope: operator checklist for proposing and rolling out an `a2a-docker-runner` release. This document is PR/release-prep only; do not tag, publish to npm, restart workers, or deploy live services from feature tasks.

## Release gate approval

The `release-gate` workflow keeps validation and tag creation in separate jobs:

- `gate` always runs first and only produces CI-safe dry-run evidence.
- `tag` runs only when `dry_run=false`, only after `gate` succeeds, and is attached to the GitHub `release` environment.
- The `release` environment must be configured in repository settings with required reviewers before a non-dry-run tag path is considered approved.
- The tag step creates an annotated release-candidate tag in the Actions checkout only. Pushing a tag, drafting or publishing a GitHub Release, publishing npm or images, deployment, provider send, terminal ACK, credential change, DB mutation, or history rewrite remains a separate explicit operator-approved action.

Use this approval gate as the implementation reference for `a2a-plane#485` and the release provenance checklist in `a2a-plane#479`.

## Pre-PR verification

- Confirm the branch is based on current `main` and does not include secrets, raw session dumps, private host paths, or OpenClaw workspace bootstrap files (`.openclaw/`, `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `BOOTSTRAP.md`, or generated `memory/` notes). The first-class OpenClaw patch profile fails closed if these appear in the checkout, including ignored files that `git status` would hide.
- For a quick repeatable package-build-test verification, run the deterministic
  `verify:package` script as a gate before the full conformance smoke:
  - `npm run verify:package`
  - Equivalent to: `npm run check && npm run build && npm run lint && npm test`
  - This is faster than the full conformance smoke and suitable for iterative
    development loops. Exits on first failure.
- Run the unified conformance smoke — a single deterministic command that runs all pre-release gates in order and exits on first failure:
  - `npm run smoke:conformance`
  - Equivalent to: `npm run check && npm run build && npm run lint && npm test && node scripts/pre-pr-bootstrap-guard.mjs --repo-dir . && npm run audit:release-candidate && npm run chaos:e2e && node --test dist/canary.test.js && node dist/cli.js --help`
  - Passing this gate means all of the following individual steps passed:
    - `npm run check` (TypeScript type-check without emit)
    - `npm run build` (TypeScript compilation)
    - `npm run lint` (syntax/`node --check` pass on all scripts)
    - `npm test` (unit tests including CI-safe canary fixture — no Docker needed)
    - `node scripts/pre-pr-bootstrap-guard.mjs --repo-dir .` (bootstrap file leak guard)
    - `npm run audit:release-candidate` (parity audit: CI gate parity, bootstrap guard coverage, chaos/receipt rollout gates, active worker targets, legacy `workerDelta` exclusion)
    - `npm run chaos:e2e` (CI-safe/mock chaos E2E gate with broker_restart, worker_kill, stale_requeue, duplicate_delivery_tolerance, network_interrupt_reconnect scenarios)
    - `node --test dist/canary.test.js` (CI-safe canary covering PR/Done/Block/malformed/failure/crash paths with fake runner binary)
    - `node dist/cli.js --help` (package bin entry point smoke)
  - To run individual gates separately (e.g. for debugging a failure): see the equivalent commands listed above.
- Run the CI-safe canary explicitly when changing handler integration code:
  - `node --test dist/canary.test.js`
  - Covers PR/Done/Block/malformed/failure/crash paths end-to-end with fake runner binary.
- Run the chaos E2E release gate before cutting a release candidate:
  - CI-safe/mock evidence: `npm run chaos:e2e`
  - Real broker/worker evidence: `node scripts/chaos-e2e-gate.mjs --real --output artifacts/chaos-e2e.json` with the command hooks documented below.
  - Attach the generated JSON evidence to the PR/release gate. It must include passing `broker_restart`, `worker_kill`, `stale_requeue`, `duplicate_delivery_tolerance`, and `network_interrupt_reconnect` scenarios.
- Treat the broker as a runtime-agnostic HTTP dependency. Real broker hooks may call Docker Compose, systemd, Kubernetes, or operator scripts, but docs/tests must not assume the broker itself is a host systemd service.
- Verify package entry points before publishing or packaging:
  - `package.json` `bin.a2a-docker-runner` points to `./dist/cli.js`.
  - `npm test` includes the package bin contract test.
  - The `npm run smoke:conformance` script includes a package bin smoke: `node dist/cli.js --help`.
- Keep GitHub Actions on non-deprecated action runtimes. Current CI uses `actions/checkout@v5` and `actions/setup-node@v5` with Node 22 so Node 20 runtime deprecation warnings do not become release noise.

## Terminal Brief ops-readiness templates (Team1/brokerAlpha lane)

The built-in template registry in `src/task-templates.ts` includes four no-live
reusable diagnostic/check templates for production operations readiness before
and after Terminal Brief activation.

Built-in template ids:

- **`terminal-brief-node-health`** — Validates runner node health: engine
  (docker/podman), task root, secret mount, base image, GitHub patch readiness,
  and deploy-marker revision match.
- **`terminal-brief-latency-diagnostics`** — Validates latency thresholds
  (p95/p99), repeated-latency diagnostic stages, diagnostics split candidates,
  and expensive-diagnostics caching guarantees.
- **`terminal-brief-session-store-residue`** — Validates OpenClaw session-store
  guard: empty active-agent registries, backup count/bytes within limits,
  cleanup rehearsal dry-run.
- **`terminal-brief-worker-readiness`** — Composite readiness gate that chains
  all three templates above plus doctor, deploy-marker, evidence contract, and
  stale-backlog checks.

All four templates ship with `A2A_DOCKER_RUNNER_NO_LIVE=1` enforced in env and
require explicit safety gates: no provider sends, Gateway/broker/worker restart,
DB mutation, terminal ACK, deployment, release, or repo visibility change.

Each template has a corresponding example fixture in `examples/`:

```
examples/terminal-brief-node-health-fixture.json
examples/terminal-brief-latency-diagnostics-fixture.json
examples/terminal-brief-session-store-residue-fixture.json
examples/terminal-brief-worker-readiness-fixture.json
```

Use within a `RunnerTask` by setting `template` to the id and providing the
required `templateVars`. Example task referencing the node-health template:

```json
{
  "id": "tb-node-health-pre-activation",
  "intent": "propose_patch",
  "template": "terminal-brief-node-health",
  "templateVars": {
    "DOCTOR_ARGS": "a2a-docker-runner doctor",
    "EXPECTED_REVISION": "f17072e",
    "TARGET_NODE": "workerAlpha"
  },
  "issueUrl": "https://github.com/jinwon-int/a2a-docker-runner/issues/270"
}
```

These templates do **not** implement Terminal Brief core feature logic (Team2/brokerBeta
scope). They are production operations and runbook tools for Team1/brokerAlpha.

## Active rollout targets

Active workers for this runner family:

- `workerGamma`
- `workerEpsilon`
- `workerBeta`
- `workerAlpha`

Excluded legacy target:

- `workerDelta` / VPS2 legacy worker is explicitly out of scope. Do not change, restart, or validate legacy workerDelta/VPS2 worker services as part of this rollout.

## Rollout sequence after merge

1. brokerAlpha/operator reviews the merged PR and CI result.
2. Build/package from the merge commit only; do not publish from an issue branch.
3. **Pre-deploy canary**: Run CI-safe canary fixture on the merge commit: `node --test dist/canary.test.js`.
4. **Deploy-marker doctor**: Before rollout, run the deploy-marker doctor to confirm the deployed runner revision matches the expected merge commit:

   ```bash
   node scripts/deploy-marker-doctor.mjs \
     --expected-revision <merge-commit-sha> \
     --repo-dir .
   ```

   The doctor fails closed when the deployed revision does not match the expected marker, when the checkout is not a git worktree, or when the local SHA cannot be resolved. It produces no-live refresh safety evidence: no provider sends, terminal ACKs, deployments, restarts, or DB mutations are performed. This check is deterministic, CI-safe, and requires no external services.
5. Collect no-live receipt-smoke evidence for all active workers (`workerGamma`, `workerEpsilon`, `workerBeta`, `workerAlpha`) into one sanitized JSON file, then run the merged-evidence guard from the merge commit:

   ```bash
   npm run rollout:receipt-evidence -- \
     --input artifacts/rollout-receipt-evidence.json \
     --expected-commit <merge-commit-sha>
   ```

   The guard fails closed if any active worker is missing, reports a different runner artifact commit, lacks an artifact version or passing focused test result, lacks operator-visible terminal receipt evidence, allows provider-send-only ACK, or has stale-backlog terminal receipt evidence. Do not include tokens, private host paths, raw session dumps, live Telegram sends, or real terminal-outbox ACKs in the merged input.
6. Roll out one active target at a time, starting with a non-critical worker when possible.
7. On each target, run `a2a-docker-runner doctor` and the deploy-marker doctor before sending real GitHub jobs:

   ```bash
   a2a-docker-runner doctor
   node scripts/deploy-marker-doctor.mjs --expected-revision <merge-commit-sha>
   ```

   Both checks must pass before sending real jobs to the target.
8. Confirm the worker completion payload preserves runner evidence fields when present: `github.prUrl`, `github.doneCommentUrl`, and `github.blockCommentUrl`.
9. Continue to the next active target only after the previous target reports healthy status and expected evidence output.

## Chaos E2E release gate

`scripts/chaos-e2e-gate.mjs` produces machine-readable JSON evidence with a stable schema (`a2a-docker-runner.chaos-e2e.v1`). The default mock mode is deterministic and CI-safe; it validates the release-gate state machine without Docker, a live broker, or credentials:

```bash
npm run chaos:e2e
# writes tmp/chaos-e2e-evidence.json and prints the same JSON to stdout
```

For a real staging broker/worker run, provide shell command hooks. Each hook receives `A2A_CHAOS_SCENARIO`, `A2A_CHAOS_STEP`, and `A2A_CHAOS_WORK_DIR`. Hook stdout/stderr is captured in the JSON evidence and redacted for common token patterns, so keep hook output concise and sanitized. The broker hook contract is deliberately supervisor-neutral: `A2A_CHAOS_BROKER_RESTART_CMD` can be a Docker Compose restart, a systemd restart, or any sanitized operator wrapper that restarts the broker behind the same HTTP endpoint and edge-secret configuration.

Required real-mode hooks by scenario:

- `broker_restart`: `A2A_CHAOS_SUBMIT_TASK_CMD`, `A2A_CHAOS_BROKER_RESTART_CMD`, `A2A_CHAOS_WAIT_RESULT_CMD`, `A2A_CHAOS_ASSERT_NO_DUPLICATE_COMPLETION_CMD`
- `worker_kill`: `A2A_CHAOS_SUBMIT_TASK_CMD`, `A2A_CHAOS_WORKER_KILL_CMD`, `A2A_CHAOS_WORKER_START_CMD`, `A2A_CHAOS_WAIT_RESULT_CMD`, `A2A_CHAOS_ASSERT_NO_DUPLICATE_COMPLETION_CMD`
- `stale_requeue`: `A2A_CHAOS_SUBMIT_TASK_CMD`, `A2A_CHAOS_WORKER_KILL_CMD`, `A2A_CHAOS_REQUEUE_STALE_CMD`, `A2A_CHAOS_WORKER_START_CMD`, `A2A_CHAOS_WAIT_RESULT_CMD`
- `duplicate_delivery_tolerance`: `A2A_CHAOS_SUBMIT_TASK_CMD`, `A2A_CHAOS_INJECT_DUPLICATE_CMD`, `A2A_CHAOS_WAIT_RESULT_CMD`, `A2A_CHAOS_ASSERT_NO_DUPLICATE_COMPLETION_CMD`
- `network_interrupt_reconnect`: `A2A_CHAOS_SUBMIT_TASK_CMD`, `A2A_CHAOS_NETWORK_DOWN_CMD`, `A2A_CHAOS_NETWORK_UP_CMD`, `A2A_CHAOS_WAIT_RESULT_CMD`, `A2A_CHAOS_ASSERT_NO_DUPLICATE_COMPLETION_CMD`

Example staging invocation:

```bash
A2A_CHAOS_SUBMIT_TASK_CMD='./ops/submit-chaos-task "$A2A_CHAOS_SCENARIO" "$A2A_CHAOS_WORK_DIR"' \
A2A_CHAOS_BROKER_RESTART_CMD='./ops/restart-staging-broker' \
A2A_CHAOS_WORKER_KILL_CMD='./ops/kill-staging-worker' \
A2A_CHAOS_WORKER_START_CMD='./ops/start-staging-worker' \
A2A_CHAOS_REQUEUE_STALE_CMD='./ops/requeue-stale --staging' \
A2A_CHAOS_INJECT_DUPLICATE_CMD='./ops/inject-duplicate-delivery --staging' \
A2A_CHAOS_NETWORK_DOWN_CMD='./ops/network-partition-worker --down' \
A2A_CHAOS_NETWORK_UP_CMD='./ops/network-partition-worker --up' \
A2A_CHAOS_WAIT_RESULT_CMD='./ops/wait-chaos-result "$A2A_CHAOS_SCENARIO" "$A2A_CHAOS_WORK_DIR"' \
A2A_CHAOS_ASSERT_NO_DUPLICATE_COMPLETION_CMD='./ops/assert-single-completion "$A2A_CHAOS_SCENARIO" "$A2A_CHAOS_WORK_DIR"' \
node scripts/chaos-e2e-gate.mjs --real --output artifacts/chaos-e2e.json
```

Failure output is intentionally non-silent: each failed scenario includes the failing hook name, a bounded/redacted output sample, and the required hook list so the operator can find broker/worker logs and task evidence quickly.

## Rollback plan

- Stop rollout immediately if CI, `doctor`, package bin smoke, or evidence reporting fails on any active target.
- Revert the worker package/config on the affected target to the last known-good release or commit.
- Re-run `a2a-docker-runner doctor` and one smoke task on the reverted target.
- Record the failed target, commit, command, and sanitized logs in the follow-up issue/PR. Do not include tokens, private key material, raw session dumps, or secret file contents.
- Keep `workerDelta` excluded during rollback unless a separate operator-approved legacy task explicitly covers it.

## CI-safe broker canary payload (Round 4+)

The repo ships a synthetic broker canary payload at `examples/broker-canary-round4.json`.
Operators use it to validate the handler-to-runner conversion and evidence contract
without touching a live broker, Docker, or GitHub.

### Payload validation

```bash
# Validate conversion of the broker canary payload through buildRunnerTaskFromHandlerPayload:
node --test dist/canary-payload.test.js

# Full end-to-end canary (includes fake runner spawn):
node --test dist/canary.test.js
```

Both tests run in CI (no Docker required).

### Active targets in the canary payload

The fixture includes explicit active target and exclusion lists:

- **Active**: `workerGamma`, `workerEpsilon`, `workerBeta`, `workerAlpha`
- **Excluded**: `workerDelta` (legacy VPS2 — do not touch)

The `operatorChecklist` inside the payload describes the per-node rollout sequence.

## Evidence interpretation guide (PR / Done / Block)

After a worker executes a `github-propose-patch` task, the handler inspects the runner
output for structured `GitHubEvidence`. Operators should understand each evidence type.

### Evidence contract (from types.ts)

```typescript
interface GitHubEvidence {
  prUrl?: string;           // PR was created → status = pr_opened
  blockCommentUrl?: string;  // Task is blocked → status = blocked
  doneCommentUrl?: string;   // Task is done (no PR needed) → status = done
}
```

### Evidence resolution (from integration.ts)

In `buildHandlerResult`, evidence is resolved with this logic:

| Runner output | Handler status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `github.prUrl` is set | `pr_opened` | Coding agent created a branch, committed changes, pushed, and opened a PR |
| `github.blockCommentUrl` is set (no PR) | `blocked` | Task is impossible or unsafe; operator should read the block comment |
| `github.doneCommentUrl` is set (no PR, no block) | `done` | Task completed without needing a PR (e.g., verification-only or no-change tasks) |
| No structured evidence at all | `blocked` | Degraded state — runner finished but coding agent produced no GitHub evidence. Risks array contains explanation. |

### How the broker canary payload maps to evidence

The fixture's `evidenceGuide` section documents each evidence path:

- **prUrl**: Runner emitted a PR URL → worker can create/push branches and open PRs through the coding-agent contract.
- **doneCommentUrl**: Runner posted a Done comment on the issue → used for tasks that complete without a PR.
- **blockCommentUrl**: Runner posted a Block comment → task is impossible or unsafe; inspect the block reason before proceeding.
- **noEvidence**: Runner completed without structured evidence → degraded state; investigate coding-agent output.

### Per-target evidence verification

After deploying to each active target, run a smoke task and check the handler result:

1. The handler result must carry `status: "pr_opened"`, `"done"`, or `"blocked"`.
2. The corresponding URL field (`prUrl`, `doneCommentUrl`, `blockCommentUrl`) must be present and point to a valid GitHub URL.
3. The `runnerRaw` field is preserved for debugging — do not strip it in production handlers.
4. If `status: "blocked"` and no evidence URL is present, check the `risks` array and the coding-agent log artifacts (`patch-command.log`, `pr-output.txt`).

### No evidence scenario (degraded)

When the runner completes but produces no evidence:

- Handler returns `status: "blocked"`.
- `summary` says "Docker runner completed without PR/Done/Block evidence".
- `risks` includes "runner completed without structured GitHub evidence".
- Operator should inspect: container logs, artifact files (especially `patch-command.log`),
  and the coding-agent contract (`commandScript` / `commandJson` / `commandTemplate`).
