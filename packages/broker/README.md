# a2a-broker

Minimal standalone A2A broker scaffold.


## Repository role in the A2A layout

`a2a-broker` is the control-plane repository for the current A2A stack.

It owns:

- broker HTTP/JSON-RPC APIs, task lifecycle, status/read models, SSE streams, cancel/reconcile, stale reaper, and persistence
- worker registration, heartbeat, queue polling, and task evidence validation
- the deployable worker handler artifact at `scripts/a2a-task-handler.mjs`

The deployable handler artifact is `scripts/a2a-task-handler.mjs`. The legacy
The former `scripts/a2a-task-handler.mjs` compatibility wrapper was removed after whole-fleet audits reported `legacyBlocked=0` and `removalSafe=true`. Point workers at `scripts/a2a-task-handler.mjs`.
- OpenClaw bridge failure semantics for host fallback paths, including watchdog/final-evidence safeguards

It does **not** own isolated task execution. Generic GitHub patch execution runs through [`jinwon-int/a2a-docker-runner`](https://github.com/jinwon-int/a2a-docker-runner). OpenClaw-facing task request/status/cancel mapping lives in [`jinwon-int/openclaw-plugin-a2a`](https://github.com/jinwon-int/openclaw-plugin-a2a).

Current production baseline as of 2026-04-30:

- active workers: `workergamma`, `workerbeta`, `workerepsilon`, `workeralpha`
- worker handler artifact: `0.2.2`
- GitHub patch tasks: Docker-first via `A2A_EXECUTOR_MODE=auto`, `A2A_DOCKER_RUNNER_SCOPE=all-github`, `A2A_DOCKER_RUNNER_ALL_GITHUB=1`
This repo is the canonical home for the A2A task protocol. The
in-process library entrypoints from the archived legacy `a2a` repo
(`runA2ATaskRequest`, `runA2ABrokerExchange`,
`applyA2ATaskProtocolUpdate`, `applyA2ATaskProtocolCancel`,
`loadA2ATaskProtocolStatusById`, plus event constructors and reducer
helpers) are **retired**. Consumers reach the same protocol behavior
over HTTP and JSON-RPC against this broker — see
`docs/a2a-protocol.md` for the canonical reference and the migration
map.

## Peer status API (`a2a.peer.status`)

A lightweight JSON-RPC method for cheap, read-only worker health queries. Designed for routing, load-shedding, and operator dashboards.

### Quick reference

**Request**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "a2a.peer.status",
  "params": { "target": "<nodeId>", "maxCacheAgeMs": 5000 },
  "id": 1
}
```

**Response** (summary mode, default)
```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "target": "<nodeId>",
  "observedAt": 1716000000000,
  "cacheAgeMs": 0,
  "gateway": { "reachable": true, "version": "...", "mode": "standalone" },
  "worker": {
    "registered": true,
    "lastHeartbeatAt": 1716000000000,
    "workerMode": "persistent",
    "capacity": { "slotsTotal": 10, "slotsBusy": 3 }
  },
  "tasks": { "active": 2, "queued": 1, "stale": 0 },
  "health": "ok"
}
```

### Health semantics (priority order)

| Health       | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `ok`        | Worker registered, heartbeat fresh, free capacity |
| `busy`      | Worker registered, heartbeat fresh, all capacity slots occupied (`active + queued >= slotsTotal`) |
| `degraded`  | Worker registered, heartbeat fresh, but has stale tasks (claimed/running tasks with missed task heartbeats) |
| `stale`     | Worker registered but last heartbeat exceeds the mode-specific threshold |
| `unreachable` | Worker not registered at all |

### Worker modes

Workers declare `workerMode` on registration/heartbeat:

| Mode         | Stale threshold | Capacity |
|-------------|----------------|----------|
| `persistent` (default) | 90 s | 10 slots |
| `mobile`    | 30 s | 3 slots |

Mobile workers (Android/Termux, laptops) use shorter stale thresholds because brief offline windows from Doze, network suspend, or lid-close are expected. The reduced capacity reflects battery/CPU constraints.

### Caller contract

- **Rate limit**: per `(caller, target)` pair, 20 req/min + 5 burst
- **Cache**: default TTL 5 s; use `maxCacheAgeMs: 0` to force recompute
- **Privacy**: summary mode excludes task messages, session transcripts, and sensitive fields. Verbose mode requires explicit scope `"a2a.peer.status.verbose"` in the JSON-RPC `scope` parameter
- **Authentication**: caller must provide a `caller` identity; unauthenticated queries return `unauthenticated`
- **Unknown target**: returns `target_unknown` error code (not a peer health)

### Usage patterns

```typescript
// Hub routing: skip busy workers
const status = await rpc("a2a.peer.status", { target: "worker-a" });
if (status.health === "busy" || status.health === "stale") {
  // Route to next available worker
}

// Operator dashboard: query all peers
for (const worker of workers) {
  const s = await rpc("a2a.peer.status", { target: worker.nodeId });
  console.log(`${worker.displayName}: ${s.health} (${s.worker.capacity?.slotsBusy}/${s.worker.capacity?.slotsTotal})`);
}
```

## Worker capacity preflight

`GET /workers/capacity` returns a compact pre-dispatch view for repeated A2A rounds. It omits task payloads/messages and reports per-worker `queued`, `claimed`, `running`, `stale`, and `active` counts plus `latestTaskUpdatedAt`.

`GET /control-tower` returns the read-only control tower slice for operator tools: queue status, recovery/attention signals, worker capacity, and Terminal Brief inbox health in one bounded response. It does not dispatch work, ACK terminal rows, replay providers, prune state, restart services, or mutate the database.

`GET /terminal-brief/inbox` returns the operator-facing Terminal Brief inbox summary plus a bounded unacked event page. The summary separates raw unacked rows from actionable unacked rows, ACK-eligible rows, provider-send-only rows, and parent-broker-only projection rows that are ACK-ineligible.

For the Team2/brokerbeta R8 comparison against Team1/brokeralpha, see [`docs/team2-brokerbeta-ops-dashboard-capacity-parity.md`](docs/team2-brokerbeta-ops-dashboard-capacity-parity.md) for the bounded dashboard/capacity semantics and GO/NO-GO checklist.

Before a brokeralpha → brokerbeta broker cutover, run the read-only two-broker guard to fail closed if the same worker id is online in both broker worker lists:

```bash
brokeralpha_BROKER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787 \
brokerbeta_BROKER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8788 \
npm run two_broker_worker_preflight
```

The guard only calls `GET /workers` on each broker. It exits `0` when no duplicate online worker ids are found, `1` when duplicates are found, and `2` for setup/fetch errors.

Example gate before assigning another round:

```bash
curl -s "$BROKER_URL/workers/capacity?stale_after_ms=120000" \
  | jq -e '.totals.staleTasks == 0 and all(.items[]; .status == "online" and .counts.active < 2)'
```

If the command exits non-zero, pause dispatch and inspect the compact response instead of repeatedly fetching large `/tasks?detail=full` snapshots.

For Termux/mobile workers such as mobilebeta, use the source-only mobile preflight
packet before active lane assignment:

```bash
npm run mobile_worker_preflight -- \
  --input fixtures/mobile-worker-preflight/slow-polling.json
```

See [`docs/mobile-worker-preflight.md`](docs/mobile-worker-preflight.md). This
is separate from Docker-runner doctor: it evaluates supplied mobile signals such
as poll interval, broker stale windows, tmux supervisor presence, local-forward
presence, and wake-lock state. It does not change live mobilebeta settings, execute
`termux-wake-lock`, dispatch work, restart services, mutate DB state, send
providers, or ACK/replay Terminal Brief rows.

## State persistence

By default, broker state is stored at:

```bash
/var/lib/a2a-broker/state.json
```

Override with:

```bash
STATE_FILE=/your/path/state.json
```

`PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is now required at boot and must be a real absolute `http` or
`https` URL. Leaving the masked placeholder in place will fail fast during
startup so the broker does not publish unusable discovery metadata.

The file store uses atomic temp-file writes plus rename, so it is good enough for phase 1 without bringing in a database yet.

Current state schema version: `5`

The broker now also applies in-memory retention before each snapshot save so
terminal exchanges, tasks, proposals, audit events, and long-stale workers do
not grow without bound.

Default retention policy:

- terminal exchanges: newest `1000` plus anything newer than `7d`
- terminal tasks: newest `2000` plus anything newer than `7d`, bounded by a
  cumulative serialized-byte budget (default: half the snapshot byte cap) so
  the state file cannot outgrow `STATE_FILE_MAX_BYTES` on the count cap alone
- terminal proposals: newest `1000` plus anything newer than `7d`
- audit events: newest `5000` plus anything newer than `7d`
- inactive workers: newest `500` plus anything seen within `14d`

Snapshot loads now reject malformed JSON and files larger than `50 MiB` by
default instead of accepting partial or poisoned state.

Retention / snapshot env vars:

```bash
BROKER_TERMINAL_RETENTION_MS=
BROKER_MAX_TERMINAL_EXCHANGES=
BROKER_MAX_TERMINAL_TASKS=
BROKER_MAX_TERMINAL_TASK_BYTES=
BROKER_MAX_TERMINAL_PROPOSALS=
BROKER_INACTIVE_WORKER_RETENTION_MS=
BROKER_MAX_INACTIVE_WORKERS=
BROKER_AUDIT_RETENTION_MS=
BROKER_MAX_AUDIT_EVENTS=
STATE_FILE_MAX_BYTES=
```

## Request identity and rate limits

Mutating routes now support broker-side requester verification using headers:

- `x-a2a-requester-id`
- `x-a2a-requester-kind`
- `x-a2a-requester-role`

With `ENFORCE_REQUESTER_IDENTITY=1`, `POST` routes verify that the requester header matches the node or actor declared in the route body or path.

Default rate limit:

- `10` requests
- per `60` seconds
- keyed by requester id when present, otherwise by client IP

Worker lifecycle traffic uses a separate bucket by default so register,
heartbeat, and claim/start/complete/fail requests do not consume the same limit
as general exchange, proposal, and audit traffic.

`x-forwarded-for` is ignored by default. Set `TRUSTED_PROXY=1` only when the
broker sits behind a reverse proxy you control and want rate limiting keyed off
the forwarded client IP instead of the direct socket peer.

Related env vars:

```bash
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SEC=60
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=10
WORKER_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SEC=60
WORKER_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=60
ENFORCE_REQUESTER_IDENTITY=1
TRUSTED_PROXY=0
EDGE_SECRET=
```

When `EDGE_SECRET` is set, detailed operator routes including `GET /health` require the
`x-a2a-edge-secret` header; `GET /livez` and `GET /.well-known/agent-card.json`
remain public minimal liveness/discovery endpoints. Non-loopback or production
startup fails closed unless an edge secret is configured, strict worker HTTP
signatures have a non-empty key registry, or `A2A_ALLOW_INSECURE_DEV=1` is set
for local-only development. This lets trusted callers use the public broker
domain directly instead of relying on host-local tunnels alone. The bundled
worker client resolves secrets in this order: `BROKER_EDGE_SECRET`,
`A2A_BROKER_EDGE_SECRET`, `EDGE_SECRET`, then `A2A_EDGE_SECRET`.

Operational note:

- `POST /tasks/requeue_stale` is a privileged maintenance route.
- It still requires requester identity headers, and the requester role must be `hub` or `operator`.
- It stays on the general rate-limit bucket, so worker lifecycle traffic keeps its own headroom.
- Phase 1 proposal auth is intentionally narrow: artifact updates are limited to the proposal source, target, or an operator.
- Validation is limited to the proposal source or target node.
- Local apply remains target-node or operator only, even after approval.
- Task lineage uses optional `parentTaskId`. Canceling a parent task now fans out to every non-terminal descendant.
- Repeated `CancelTask` / `POST /tasks/:id/cancel` calls are idempotent. The broker returns the existing terminal task unchanged and keeps the original cancellation record.
- Cancel terminal metadata is stored on `TaskRecord.cancellation` as `requestedAt`, `requestedBy`, optional `reason`, and optional `sourceTaskId`. `sourceTaskId` is set only for fan-out descendants and points to the immediate parent task that caused the child cancel.

## Stale-task reaper

The broker runs a periodic in-process stale-task reaper so that restart recovery
is self-healing after node, worker, or broker restarts. Without it, claimed or
running tasks pointing at a dead worker stayed stuck until an operator manually
hit `POST /tasks/requeue_stale`.

Defaults:

- enabled
- sweep interval: 60s
- stale threshold (`olderThan`): falls back to `WORKER_OFFLINE_AFTER_SEC`

Env vars:

```bash
STALE_REAPER_ENABLED=1
STALE_REAPER_INTERVAL_SEC=60
STALE_REAPER_OLDER_THAN_SEC=90
BROKER_MAX_REQUEUE_ATTEMPTS=5
```

Each sweep calls the same `requeue_only` code path as the manual endpoint and
keeps `assignedWorkerId` untouched. `GET /health` exposes `staleReaper` with the
current config, `runCount`, `lastRunAt`, `lastRequeued`, `lastDeadLettered`,
`totalDeadLettered`, `maxRequeueAttempts`, and the most recent `lastError` (if
any) so operators can verify the loop is alive. Set `STALE_REAPER_ENABLED=0` if
you prefer to drive recovery manually.

### Requeue cap and dead-letter

To stop a flapping worker or a poisoned payload from thrashing the queue forever,
each task tracks a `requeueCount` and the broker caps how many automatic recoveries
it will do. When a task has already been requeued `BROKER_MAX_REQUEUE_ATTEMPTS`
times (default `5`), the next stale-recovery pass moves it to `failed` with
`error.code = "exceeded_requeue_limit"` instead of requeuing it again. Operator
reassignment through `POST /tasks/:id/reassign` resets `requeueCount` back to `0`
so the fresh target gets a clean attempt budget. Set
`BROKER_MAX_REQUEUE_ATTEMPTS=0` to disable the cap (unlimited requeues, legacy
behavior).

`POST /tasks/requeue_stale` now also returns `deadLettered` and
`deadLetteredItems` (with the final `requeueCount`, `error`, and updated
timestamp) alongside the usual `requeued` list, so operators can see the full
outcome of a sweep without a follow-up `/audit` query.

## Quick start

```bash
cd a2a-broker
cp .env.example .env
# replace PUBLIC_BASE_URL with the real reverse-proxy or public broker URL
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

Health check:

```bash
curl -H "x-a2a-edge-secret: $EDGE_SECRET" http://127.0.0.1:8787/health
# Public minimal liveness remains unauthenticated:
curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/livez
```

Start a worker daemon against the broker:

```bash
BROKER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787 \
WORKER_ID=worker-a \
WORKER_ROLE=analyst \
WORKER_HANDLER_BUILTIN=echo \
npm run start:worker
```

The worker registers itself, sends heartbeats, polls queued tasks assigned to `WORKER_ID`, claims and starts them, then completes or fails them.

For two-broker deployments, set a stable broker id on the broker and pin workers to it:

```bash
A2A_BROKER_ID=team2-broker npm start
A2A_HOME_BROKER_ID=team2-broker \
A2A_HOME_BROKER_LEASE_FILE=/var/lib/a2a-broker-worker/home-broker.json \
npm run start:worker
```

When `A2A_HOME_BROKER_ID` is set, the worker verifies `/health.brokerId` before any broker API request. If the broker id is missing, mismatched, or the local lease file was created for another broker id, startup fails closed.

Run the end-to-end smoke stack (broker plus built-in echo worker in Docker):

```bash
docker compose -f examples/docker-compose.smoke.yml up --build -d
```

Follow `docs/smoke-compose.md` to seed a task from the shell and
verify it reaches `succeeded`.

Run the restart recovery smoke:

```bash
BROKER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787 \
BROKER_EDGE_SECRET=YOUR_EDGE_SECRET \
npm run smoke:restart-recovery
```

Override `BROKER_RESTART_CMD` when the broker is not managed by `systemd`.

For an external task handler, point the worker at a command plus JSON args:

```bash
BROKER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787 \
WORKER_ID=worker-a \
WORKER_ROLE=analyst \
WORKER_HANDLER_COMMAND=node \
WORKER_HANDLER_ARGS_JSON='["/opt/a2a/handler.mjs"]' \
npm run start:worker
```

The external handler receives the task JSON on stdin and must write a JSON object to stdout. It may return either a task result object directly, or an envelope like `{ "result": { ... } }` or `{ "error": { "message": "..." } }`.

### Broker poll/HTTP external-handler workers

External-handler workers do not need Gateway plugin hooks or Gateway-internal
session methods to execute broker tasks. Use the neutral broker poll-only profile
for workers that register with the broker, heartbeat, poll/claim/start/complete/fail
over HTTP, and hand each task to a stdin/stdout handler.

```bash
BROKER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787 \
WORKER_ID=workerdelta \
WORKER_ROLE=analyst \
A2A_WORKER_PROFILE=broker-poll-only \
A2A_EXECUTOR_MODE=auto \
A2A_DOCKER_RUNNER_SCOPE=all-github \
WORKER_HANDLER_COMMAND=node \
WORKER_HANDLER_ARGS_JSON='["/opt/a2a/scripts/a2a-task-handler.mjs"]' \
npm run start:worker
```

`A2A_WORKER_PROFILE=broker-poll-only` declares
`runtimeFlavor=broker-poll-http-handler`, `gatewayRequired=false`,
`executionPlane=broker-poll-http-handler`, and `handlerContract=stdin-stdout` in
worker registration metadata.

The legacy `A2A_WORKER_PROFILE=openclaw-poll-only` still exists as a compatibility
alias for already deployed workers. It reports `runtimeFlavor=openclaw-poll-handler`
and forces `A2A_OPENCLAW_BRIDGE_DISABLED=1` for the external handler process so an
accidental `OPENCLAW_BIN` value cannot turn the worker back into a
Gateway/session bridge executor. New worker docs and deployments should use
`broker-poll-only`; see `docs/worker-poll-profile-migration.md` before removing
legacy names or wrapper files.

For Hermes nodes, leave `A2A_WORKER_PROFILE` unset and use
`A2A_WORKER_RUNTIME_FLAVOR=termux-hermes` with `A2A_WORKER_GATEWAY_REQUIRED=false`
instead. If the task is delegated into a container, the container harness should
be Hermes-specific rather than OpenClaw-specific.

Keep `plugin-a2a` as an optional operator/Gateway presentation plane for
status cards, outbox notifications, and Terminal Brief visibility. Worker task
execution should stay valid without that plugin being loaded.

Create exchange:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8787/exchanges \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "requester": { "id": "<hub-node>", "kind": "node" },
    "target": { "id": "mobilealpha", "kind": "node" },
    "message": "ping",
    "maxTurns": 8
  }'
```


## Worker Runtime

The broker ships a built-in worker client (`A2ABrokerWorker`) that handles
registration, heartbeats, task polling, claim/start/complete/fail lifecycle,
and proposal APIs.

### Intent Router

Workers use an **intent router** to dispatch tasks to the correct handler
based on `task.intent`.  Middleware can be layered via `beforeHandle` hooks.

```ts
import { createIntentRouter, withProposalContext } from "./workers/intent-router.js";
import { createValidateProposalHandler, createApplyProposalHandler,
         createProposePatchHandler, createProposeParamsHandler } from "./workers/proposal-handlers.js";

const router = createIntentRouter({
  beforeHandle: [withProposalContext(apiWorker)],
  handlers: [
    { intent: "validate_change", handler: createValidateProposalHandler(apiWorker, myValidator) },
    { intent: "apply_local_change", handler: createApplyProposalHandler(myApplier) },
    { intent: "propose_patch", handler: createProposePatchHandler(apiWorker) },
    { intent: "propose_params", handler: createProposeParamsHandler(apiWorker) },
  ],
});
```

### Proposal Handler Plugins

Each handler accepts a plugin interface so teams can inject custom logic:

| Handler | Plugin Interface | Description |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| `createValidateProposalHandler` | `ProposalValidator` | Runs validation, returns verdict + kind |
| `createApplyProposalHandler` | `ProposalApplier` | Applies the change locally |
| `createProposePatchHandler` | — (uses `apiWorker`) | Creates a patch proposal on broker |
| `createProposeParamsHandler` | — (uses `apiWorker`) | Creates a params proposal on broker |

The broker's `completeTask` flow automatically handles proposal state
transitions based on the handler's return value — validate handlers return
a `validation` field, apply handlers return an `apply` field.  **Handlers
must not call `submitValidation` or `applyProposal` APIs directly**, as that
would cause double-invocation.

### Task Assertions

Handlers use assertion helpers from `intent-router.ts` to validate task
payloads.  Failed assertions throw `TaskAssertionError` which carries a
structured `WorkerHandlerOutcome` with an error code.  Handlers should
catch `TaskAssertionError` and return its `.outcome` to ensure the task
gets the correct error code.

```ts
assertProposalTask(task, "validate_change");   // checks intent + proposalId
assertWorkspaceTask(task);                     // checks workspace field
assertPayloadField(task, "targetNodeId");      // checks payload field exists
```

### Proposal Context Middleware

`withProposalContext(worker)` preloads `task.payload.__proposalDetails` for
tasks that have a `proposalId`, so handlers can access proposal metadata
without an extra round-trip.

### Tests

Run all tests (no build required):

```bash
npx tsx --test src/core/broker.test.ts src/server.test.ts   src/workers/intent-router.test.ts src/workers/proposal-handlers.test.ts   src/worker.test.ts
```

Current: **51 tests, 0 failures**.
## Docker

```bash
cd a2a-broker
cp .env.example .env
# set PUBLIC_BASE_URL to a masked placeholder or your reverse-proxy name
# example: PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://<masked-a2a-endpoint>
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose logs -f
```

## Masking rule

- inside Docker and service-to-service traffic, use the stable service name `a2a-broker`
- outside Docker, do not hardcode host IPs or machine names in docs, configs, or logs
- use placeholders like `<masked-host>` or a public alias variable such as `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`

## Next likely steps

1. swap in-memory store for durable persistence
2. add exchange state transitions
3. add OpenClaw adapter
4. add transport auth if needed beyond requester verification
