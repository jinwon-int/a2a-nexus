# Receipt-gated ACK canary smoke runbook (#241)

Use this runbook for the #241/#168 closeout canary when validating that
terminal notification ACKs are gated on receipt evidence and that replay does
not create a duplicate Telegram flood. It is intentionally broker-safe: the
default path is dry-run/manual evidence only, does not deploy production, and
does not send Telegram messages.

## Safety rules

1. **Default to dry-run.** Do not enable notifier live delivery, deploy
   production, rotate secrets, or call Telegram from this runbook.
2. **ACK only after receipt evidence.** Gateway/provider send success is not
   sufficient. The broker ACK endpoint accepts only:
   - `operator_visible`
   - `operator_confirmed`
   - `provider_delivery_receipt`
3. **Live-send is a separate approval gate.** Any staged Telegram send must be
   approved explicitly by the command-center operator in the relevant issue
   thread before it is run. Keep those commands out of copy/paste default blocks.
4. **Redact sensitive data.** Evidence may include task ids, outbox ids,
   timestamps, cursors, ACK status, and sanitized summaries. Do not post bot
   tokens, chat ids, raw logs, transcript paths, or host-private secret paths.

## Preconditions

- Broker candidate includes receipt-gated terminal outbox ACK behavior.
- Run the no-live receipt-gate canary matrix first: see [receipt-gate-canary-matrix.md](receipt-gate-canary-matrix.md).
- Plugin candidate includes the duplicate Telegram flood regression fix.
- Local checkout is clean except for the candidate under test.
- For live/staged checks, the command-center issue has named the operator,
  target environment, candidate SHAs, and rollback owner.

## Phase 0 — CI-safe proof

Run the broker tests that cover terminal outbox replay and receipt-gated ACK:

```bash
npm test
```

Minimum evidence to capture:

- test command and exit code;
- candidate broker SHA;
- candidate plugin SHA or PR reference;
- no secret-bearing output included.

## Phase 1 — Broker-only dry-run smoke

Start with the read-only broker preflight before creating or ACKing any canary
record:

```bash
BROKER_URL="${BROKER_URL:-http://127.0.0.1:8787}" \
  BROKER_EDGE_SECRET="${BROKER_EDGE_SECRET:-}" \
  npm run rollout -- terminal_outbox_preflight --json
```

The preflight checks broker health and terminal-outbox poll/replay state with
`reconcile_unacked=true`. It never calls `/ack`, never sends Telegram, and is
safe to run against a candidate broker before smoke. Treat failed health,
unauthorized outbox access, missing stable event ids, non-HTTP evidence URLs, or
failed replay as Block evidence.

This phase verifies the ACK gate without contacting Telegram.

1. Start a local broker or use the PR validation broker instance.
2. Create or identify one terminal outbox record from a safe no-op task.
3. Poll the terminal outbox and record the returned `id`, cursor, and sanitized
   payload summary.
4. Attempt an invalid ACK using send-success-only evidence. The expected result
   is a non-2xx response with a message equivalent to: `receipt evidence` is
   required and provider send success alone is not accepted.
5. Reconcile with `reconcile_unacked=true` from the same cursor. The same record
   must still be replayable because it has not received receipt evidence.
6. ACK manually with receipt evidence only after a human-visible or simulated
   receipt is available:

```bash
curl -fsS -X POST "$BROKER_URL/a2a/tasks/terminal-outbox/ack" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "x-edge-secret: $BROKER_EDGE_SECRET" \
  --data '{
    "id": "<terminal-outbox-id>",
    "receipt": {
      "evidence": "operator_visible",
      "acknowledgedAt": "<iso8601>",
      "receiptId": "dry-run-manual-receipt-<short-id>",
      "note": "manual dry-run receipt for #241/#168 closeout"
    }
  }'
```

7. Re-poll/reconcile and verify the record reports `ack.status =
   receipt_confirmed` with the expected evidence and receipt id.

Pass criteria:

- invalid send-success-only ACK is rejected;
- unacknowledged record remains replayable across cursor reconciliation;
- valid receipt ACK records receipt metadata;
- no Telegram send occurs.

## Phase 2 — Duplicate replay guard dry-run

Use the same terminal outbox record or a controlled duplicate scenario.

1. Poll with the last saved cursor.
2. Poll again with `reconcile_unacked=true` from the cursor before ACK.
3. Confirm the notifier/plugin dry-run would dedupe by stable outbox `id` and
   would not enqueue a second Telegram delivery for the same id.
4. After valid receipt ACK, repeat reconciliation and confirm the record is no
   longer treated as an undelivered retry candidate.

Pass criteria:

- at most one delivery attempt is planned for each outbox `id`;
- replay before receipt does not advance the cursor in a way that hides the
  unacknowledged record;
- receipt ACK closes the retry candidate without deleting audit/replay evidence.

## Explicit approval gate for staged live-send

Do not run this section by default. A staged Telegram send is allowed only when a
command-center operator posts an explicit approval that names all of the
following:

- approved environment and node;
- exact broker/plugin/OpenClaw SHAs;
- Telegram target class (for example, a non-production operator test chat);
- maximum number of sends, normally `1`;
- rollback owner and stop condition.

After approval, the transport owner may execute their plugin/notifier-specific
staged send procedure outside this broker runbook. The broker-side closeout
still requires receipt evidence before ACK. If approval is absent, post `Block:`
evidence instead of attempting live delivery.

## Rollback / stop conditions

Stop immediately and preserve evidence if any of these occur:

- duplicate Telegram sends are observed or planned for the same outbox `id`;
- send-success-only evidence is accepted as an ACK;
- `reconcile_unacked=true` fails to replay an unacknowledged record;
- notifier/plugin dry-run cannot prove id-based dedupe;
- live-send approval is missing, ambiguous, or broader than one staged canary.

Rollback order for staged checks:

1. Disable/pause notifier live delivery first.
2. Preserve the last cursor, outbox id, receipt id, and notifier dedupe key.
3. Reconcile unacknowledged broker records with `reconcile_unacked=true`.
4. ACK only records with valid receipt evidence; leave the rest replayable.
5. Post `Block:` evidence with exact failed gate and rollback status.

## Evidence comment template

The final command-center comment can be rendered from a sanitized evidence file
without performing any live operation:

```bash
node scripts/receipt-gated-smoke-evidence.mjs --input evidence.json
```

The collector is intentionally read-only. It does not deploy, restart Gateway,
send Telegram, or ACK terminal outbox records. For the default no-live rollout,
it requires an explicit proof matrix covering CI, read-only preflight, ACK gate,
replay, duplicate suppression, and rollback/cleanup cells, and it blocks if any
live send is reported. If required receipt-gated proof is missing, it exits
non-zero and renders a `Block:` comment instead of a false `Done:`. A minimal
no-live dry-run evidence file contains:

```json
{
  "rolloutMode": "no-live",
  "candidates": { "broker": "<sha>", "plugin": "<sha-or-PR-164>" },
  "ci": { "command": "npm test", "result": "<exit-code/link>" },

    "reconcileReplayBeforeReceipt": { "status": "pass", "evidence": "<same id replayed before receipt>" },

    "rollbackNoLiveCleanup": { "status": "pass", "evidence": "<live delivery unchanged; records replayable>" }
  },
  "dryRunAckGate": {
    "outboxId": "<id>",
    "invalidAckRejected": true,
    "invalidAckStatus": "<status/message>",
    "reconcileUnackedReplayedBeforeReceipt": true,
    "validReceiptEvidence": "operator_visible",
    "ackStatus": "receipt_confirmed"
  },
  "duplicateGuard": {
    "dedupeKey": "<outbox-id/plugin-key>",
    "plannedTelegramSendsForSameId": 1,
    "replayAfterReceiptClosedRetryCandidate": true
  },
  "liveSendGate": { "sendsExecuted": 0 },
  "rollbackCleanup": {
    "notifierLiveDeliveryDisabledOrUnchanged": true,
    "unacknowledgedRecordsRemainReplayable": "yes"
  }
}
```

For this no-live rollout matrix, `liveSendGate.sendsExecuted` must remain `0`.
Do not include a live-send approval URL in no-live evidence; staged live-send
approval belongs to a separate operator-approved run.
