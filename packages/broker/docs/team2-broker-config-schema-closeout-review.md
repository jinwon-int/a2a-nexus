# Team2 broker config/schema closeout review

Parent: `a2a-plane#249` (a2a-plane#249, internal tracker private)
Reviewed PR: [`a2a-broker#498`](https://github.com/jinwon-int/a2a-broker/pull/498)
Lane: Team2 / brokerbeta / workerepsilon

## Scope

This closeout review checks whether PR #498 safely addresses the broker config/schema alignment lane from `a2a-broker#496` without broadening runtime risk.

Reviewed surfaces:

- Broker runtime env usage in `src/server.ts`.
- Worker daemon env usage in `src/worker.ts`.
- Public operator registration surface in `.env.example`.
- Regression guard added by PR #498: `src/config-env-alignment.test.ts`.

## Findings

- PR #498 expands `.env.example` from a partial operational example into the repository's explicit env-field registry for both broker and worker runtime configuration.
- The new regression test discovers env names from direct `process.env.FOO`, `env.FOO`, and `requiredEnv(env, [...])` usage, then fails if any discovered field is missing from `.env.example`.
- Compatibility aliases are covered in the proposed registry, including broker identity/revision aliases, SQLite state aliasing, worker `A2A_*` aliases, and `NODE_ID`.
- No production deploy, broker restart, worker restart, live provider send, terminal ACK, DB mutation, secret/visibility change, release, force-push, or community post is required for this lane closeout.

## Closeout gates

| Gate | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Config field registration | GO | PR #498 adds `.env.example` entries for broker and worker env fields currently read by source. |
| Future drift guard | GO | PR #498 adds `src/config-env-alignment.test.ts`; GitHub checks for PR head `cfac4cd3d6e8b63c9d82a63c2ba71499564ed828` are green. |
| Two-broker safety boundary | GO | Review is source-only and does not request broker or worker retargeting. |
| Runtime/bootstrap context leak guard | GO | This closeout branch check found no repo-relative `AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, or `.openclaw/**` paths. |

## Recommendation

PR #498 is safe to keep as the Team2 broker config/schema alignment fix for `a2a-plane#249`, subject to the normal repository review and merge policy. The remaining closeout action is to preserve this review note as cross-repo evidence and keep the source-public / approval execution gates at NO-GO unless explicitly approved.
