# Public/Stable Readiness Checklist

Use this checklist before any `a2a-broker` visibility change, stable label, release
announcement, or Family Wiki/runbook promotion. It is a decision checklist, not a
release action: completing it does **not** change repository visibility, publish a
package, deploy production, restart Gateway, send live Telegram traffic, mutate a
DB, or ACK terminal outbox rows.

## Repository responsibility boundaries

| Repository | Owns | Does not own for this gate |
|---|---|---|
| `jinwon-int/a2a-broker` | Broker HTTP/JSON-RPC APIs, AgentCard discovery, task lifecycle, worker registration/heartbeat/queueing, status/read models, SSE, persistence, evidence validation, broker docs, and broker release gates. | Isolated GitHub patch execution, OpenClaw plugin UX, repo visibility changes, package publishing, production deploys, or provider delivery ACKs. |
| `jinwon-int/openclaw-plugin-a2a` | OpenClaw-facing request/status/cancel mapping, operator/plugin config, and caller UX into the broker. | Broker protocol semantics, broker persistence migrations, or docker-runner container execution. |
| `jinwon-int/a2a-docker-runner` | Isolated Docker execution for GitHub patch tasks and runner-owned artifact/evidence collection. | Broker task state machines, plugin routing UX, or release decisions for this repo. |

## Required gates

- [ ] **Operator approval boundary:** seoseo explicitly approves the intended
  public/stable action after reviewing this checklist and all lane evidence.
- [ ] **No action creep:** this gate only records readiness. Do not change repo
  visibility, publish packages/images, deploy production, restart Gateway, send
  live Telegram traffic, mutate DB rows, or ACK terminal outbox entries unless a
  separate operator approval names that exact action.
- [ ] **License decision:** a root `LICENSE` file is present and matches the
  approved release intent, or the release is blocked with an explicit owner/date
  for the license decision. `package.json.private=true` is not itself a license.
- [ ] **Secret/history scan:** run a fresh scan of committed history and the
  working tree. Findings must be redacted (`<redacted>`/placeholders only) and
  either remediated or accepted by seoseo before visibility changes.
- [ ] **Repository visibility review:** confirm branch protection, CODEOWNERS or
  review owners if used, issue/PR templates, default branch, and public-facing
  metadata before changing visibility.
- [ ] **Docs review:** README, quickstart, `.env.example`, protocol compatibility,
  release gate, and rollback docs describe the current broker behavior without
  host-specific paths, secret values, or private topology leaks.
- [ ] **Compatibility matrix:** `docs/protocol-compatibility.md` reflects the
  advertised AgentCard/JSON-RPC profile, non-goals, and conformance tests.
- [ ] **Cross-repo alignment:** plugin and runner docs/issues agree on the
  broker/plugin/runner responsibility split above; do not present this repo as a
  monorepo or as owning runner/plugin releases.
- [ ] **Independent source-public risk audit:** attach a current broker audit
  record (for example, `docs/source-public-risk-audit-20260510.md`) that
  cross-checks hidden coupling, private topology assumptions, scanner/history
  requirements, public API docs, and approval boundaries against the parallel
  lane evidence.
- [ ] **CI:** default branch CI is green for the exact commit proposed for public
  or stable readiness.
- [ ] **Local validation:** run `npm test` or, at minimum for docs-only changes,
  `npm run build` plus a focused docs/link inspection. Record exact commands and
  summarized output.
- [ ] **Smoke/release gate:** run the appropriate broker gate from
  `docs/release-gate.md` (`npm run release_gate`, `npm run docker_runtime_preflight
  -- --dry-run`, and/or approved no-live closeout report inputs). Any live-impact
  lane requires separate approval.
- [ ] **Rollback plan:** identify the owner and exact rollback path for docs,
  release tags, package/image publication, repo visibility, and production config.
- [ ] **Evidence links:** attach PR/Done/Block evidence to the readiness issue
  with sanitized command output and links to CI, smoke results, and unresolved
  blockers.

## Redacted sanitization scan

Run the scan before publishing or linking public/stable evidence:

```bash
npm run scan:public-readiness
```

The scan covers `README.md`, `.env.example`, `docs/`, and `examples/` for:

- concrete secret-like assignments (`*SECRET*`, `*TOKEN*`, `*PASSWORD*`, `*API_KEY*`)
- Telegram chat targets
- private host aliases
- non-allowlisted URLs that should be confirmed public or converted to placeholders

Output is redacted by default. Findings only include file, line, category, and a
sanitized excerpt. A non-zero exit means a high-confidence public-safety issue must
be fixed before the lane can be marked Done. Warnings are review prompts; either
replace the value with a role placeholder or keep the warning as explicit review
evidence when the reference is intentionally public.

For machine-readable evidence:

```bash
npm run scan:public-readiness -- --json
```

Do not paste raw secrets, private paths, chat IDs, host-local session dumps, or
unredacted command logs into issues or PRs.

## Local broker + dummy-worker smoke

Use the existing single-host smoke stack to prove the broker can accept a task and
a dummy worker can complete it without live infrastructure:

```bash
docker compose -f examples/docker-compose.smoke.yml up --build -d
curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:8787/health | head -c 400 ; echo
curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:8787/workers | head -c 400 ; echo
```

Then follow `docs/smoke-compose.md` to create a task for `echo-worker-1`, poll it
to `status:"succeeded"`, and inspect the task audit trail. The compose file uses
the built-in `echo` handler from `src/worker.ts`; it does not require external
workers, edge secrets, live Telegram, or production state.

When finished:

```bash
docker compose -f examples/docker-compose.smoke.yml down --volumes
```

## Evidence checklist

Public/stable Done or PR evidence should include only compact, redacted output:

- independent source-public risk audit link and parity/reconciliation status
- `npm run scan:public-readiness` summary and any sanitized warnings
- local smoke command names and pass/fail status
- task lifecycle summary (`queued` to `succeeded`) if the Docker smoke was run
- explicit statement that no forbidden live action was performed

## Release decision record

Before announcing stable/public readiness, fill this in on the issue or release
runbook:

- Decision: `Block` / `Proceed to visibility review` / `Proceed to stable label`
- Commit/PR:
- Approver:
- CI evidence:
- Local validation:
- Smoke/release-gate evidence:
- Secret/history scan result: `clean` / `remediated` / `blocked`
- License decision:
- Rollback owner and path:
- Deferred follow-ups:

If any required gate is unknown, stale, or unapproved, the decision is `Block`.
