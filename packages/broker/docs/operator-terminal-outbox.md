# Operator Terminal Outbox Contract

The broker projects terminal task lifecycle events into a compact `task.terminal` outbox for an external notifier such as `<notifier-host>/OpenClaw` `plugin-notifier`.

The broker does **not** call Telegram, OpenClaw main-session delivery, or any other operator transport directly. It only exposes replayable, operator-safe records; the notifier owns polling/SSE consumption, dedupe, acknowledgement, and Telegram/main-session push.

## Record shape

Each outbox record contains only:

- stable `id` for notifier dedupe and replay cursors
- `kind: "task.terminal"`
- source `taskEventId`
- `createdAt`, explicit notification `receipt`, optional receipt-confirmed `ack`, legacy `deliveredAt` only from older snapshots, and `attempts`
- `payload` with `taskId`, terminal `status`, optional `worker`, timestamps, optional GitHub `repo`/`issue`, safe HTTP evidence URLs (`prUrl`, `doneUrl`, `blockUrl`), and a short redacted summary

Records must not include raw logs, secrets, prompts, session transcripts, arbitrary payload fields, or private local paths.

## HTTP adapter for plugin/OpenClaw notifiers

A notifier can consume the broker-owned outbox without subscribing to raw task state:

- `GET /a2a/tasks/terminal-outbox?after_id=<cursor>&limit=<n>` returns `{ kind, count, cursor, events }`.
- Save the response `cursor` (or the last event `id`) and pass it as `after_id` on the next poll.
- Add `reconcile_unacked=true` after restart or when the notifier suspects a send/ack gap. The broker prepends retained records at/before `after_id` that still lack receipt-confirmed `ack`, then appends newer records. The returned cursor only advances for newer records; retrying an old unacknowledged record never marks the cursor complete by itself.
- `POST /a2a/tasks/terminal-outbox/ack` requires visibility evidence, for example `{ "id": "...", "receipt": { "evidence": "current_session_visible", "acknowledgedAt": "...", "receiptId": "message-id" } }`.
- Valid ACK evidence values are `current_session_visible`, `operator_visible`, and `operator_confirmed`. Gateway/provider send success, provider message IDs, and provider delivery receipts are receipt telemetry only; they are not terminal ACK evidence.
- Receipt status is deliberately separate from task terminal status and provider send status. Broker records use the small vocabulary `accepted`, `started`, `produced`, `provider_sent`, `provider_accepted`, `current_session_visible`, `operator_visible`, `timed_out`, `stale`, and `failed`. A succeeded task with any receipt status other than `current_session_visible` or `operator_visible` still has a current-session/operator-visible receipt gap; provider/API send success is recorded as `provider_sent` or `provider_accepted`, not ACKed receipt.
- One-shot live eligibility is stricter than send success: the dry-run projection remains `oneShotLiveEligible=false` until every retained terminal outbox row has manual operator confirmation (`ack.status=receipt_confirmed`, `receipt.status=operator_visible`, and `ack.evidence`/receipt evidence of `operator_visible` or `operator_confirmed`). Provider send success, `provider_sent`, `provider_accepted`, `current_session_visible`, or `provider_delivery_receipt` alone are blocked for one-shot live-send approval.
- Both routes require an authenticated hub/operator requester when edge identity enforcement is enabled.

## Operator read model

`GET /operator/task-report` includes the same terminal-outbox state in each matching terminal task as `terminalBrief` so operators/plugins do not need to join raw task payloads with outbox rows themselves. The compact brief includes the stable outbox `cursor`, `receiptStatus`, `ackStatus`, optional `ackDecision`/reason, worker/repo/issue/task brief metadata, and the first safe PR/Done/Block evidence URL. The report's top-level `receiptStatus` is derived from the broker outbox when present, so a provider-send-only notification remains visible as `provider_sent` / `provider_accepted` / receipt gap until current-session-visible or operator-visible ACK evidence is recorded.

Worker assignment SSE (`GET /a2a/workers/{workerId}/assignment-events`) remains a wake hint for queued work only. It is useful for reducing worker polling, but it is not operator-visible receipt evidence and must never be used to ACK terminal-outbox records.

## GitHub evidence comments

`src/github/terminal-brief-evidence.ts` is the first-class GitHub issue/PR comment projection for Terminal Brief evidence. It renders manifest-bound `Start` / `PR` / `Done` / `Block` comments with a stable idempotency key and SHA-256 manifest digest, then plans `create`, `update`, or `noop` writes against existing issue comments. Replaying the same Terminal Brief evidence should therefore converge on one comment instead of producing duplicate ledger entries.

These comments are evidence ledger entries only. Creating or updating them must not call terminal-outbox ACK APIs, mark read/visibility state, imply operator approval, mutate production DB/provider state, or perform live sends. The projection redacts token-shaped content and fails closed if OpenClaw runtime/bootstrap context paths such as `AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, or `.openclaw/**` would enter the comment manifest/body.

## Broker main vs live container deploy-readiness note

The broker code on `origin/main` can be considered deploy-ready for Terminal Brief only after the local candidate passes build/tests plus the no-live outbox preflight, and the live container image/revision is confirmed to include that same broker commit. If the live container is behind `origin/main`, plugin/operator consumers may see older surfaces even though `main` is ready; close the gap by scheduling a normal broker rollout with operator approval, not by restarting or deploying from this readiness check.

### Telegram/OpenClaw receipt mapping note

In the seoseo OpenClaw checkout inspected for #396, the Telegram outbound provider path is `extensions/telegram/src/send.ts` (`sendMessageTelegram`; bundled dist module `dist/send-*.js`). That function resolves the target, calls Telegram Bot API send methods, records the sent `messageId`/`chatId`, and returns `{ messageId, chatId }`. It is provider-acceptance evidence only; it does not prove that the current OpenClaw session rendered the message and it is not manual operator confirmation.

Recommended adapter contract from OpenClaw/plugin-notifier to this broker:

- Telegram `sendMessageTelegram` success / `messageId` only: `POST /a2a/tasks/terminal-outbox/receipt` with `status: "provider_sent"` and no terminal-outbox ACK.
- Current-session render of the terminal brief: `POST /a2a/tasks/terminal-outbox/ack` with `receipt.evidence: "current_session_visible"`, which maps to `receipt.status: "current_session_visible"`.
- Manual operator confirmation: `POST /a2a/tasks/terminal-outbox/ack` with `receipt.evidence: "operator_confirmed"` or `"operator_visible"`, which maps to `receipt.status: "operator_visible"`.

Negative test case: a Telegram provider send result shaped like `deliveryState: "provider_accepted"`, `providerAccepted: true`, `operatorVisible: false`, `ackRequired: false`, or any equivalent send-success-only response must remain `receipt.status: "provider_sent"` and must not call the terminal-outbox ACK route.

Safe pre-deploy commands:

```sh
npm run build
npm run terminal_outbox_preflight -- --no-live --json
npm run smoke:docker-broker -- --dry-run
```

Rollback plan: keep the previous broker image/tag and SQLite snapshot backup available, stop at the first failed health/outbox/read-model check, and revert to the last known-good broker container through the approved deployment runbook. This note is documentation only; it does not authorize production deploys, Gateway restarts, live provider sends, DB mutation, worker restarts, or terminal-outbox ACKs.

## Release/deploy readiness smoke

Before any live deploy, run the broker-side dry-run smoke first; it does not send Telegram messages or deploy services:

```sh
npm run smoke:docker-broker -- --dry-run
```

For a post-approval live validation, operators can use `npm run smoke:docker-broker -- --live` or the fleet variant from `docs/docker-broker-live-smoke.md`. Do not run live smokes or deploy without explicit operator approval.

For the #241/#168 duplicate Telegram flood closeout, use the receipt-gated canary smoke runbook in [receipt-gated-ack-canary-runbook.md](receipt-gated-ack-canary-runbook.md). It keeps dry-run/manual receipt ACK as the default path and treats any staged live Telegram send as an explicit command-center approval gate.

For the R4 move from manual ACK to automatic current-session-visible receipt ACK, use [terminal-brief-r4-automatic-receipt-ack-runbook.md](terminal-brief-r4-automatic-receipt-ack-runbook.md). It records the backlog drain, one-shot fuse, Gateway restart caveat, manual receipt fallback, automatic receipt contract, supplemental post-dispatch verifier, and go/no-go gates.

For release-gate closeout comments or pre-remediation evidence, generate the read-only terminal receipt report directly from the SQLite hot table:

```sh
npm run terminal_receipt_closeout_report -- --db "$BROKER_SQLITE_FILE" --legacy-residue-cutoff 2026-05-04T07:10:00.000Z
```

The report groups current post-cutoff gaps separately from cutoff-quarantined legacy residue and maps each gap to terminal event id, task event id, task id, terminal status, age, receipt state, and remediation hint. It intentionally excludes raw payloads, secrets, local paths, and evidence bodies; it never sends notifications, mutates SQLite, or writes terminal ACKs.

For stale accepted terminal outbox rows that are tied to already-completed historical work, use [terminal-outbox-stale-accepted-residue-runbook.md](terminal-outbox-stale-accepted-residue-runbook.md). That runbook defines preserve, stale/hide, ACK, cleanup, replay-avoidance, and health-warning semantics without authorizing live cleanup or manual ACK.

## Replay, ack, and retention

- Consumers replay with `subscribe({ afterId })`; HTTP consumers pass the same stable cursor as `after_id`.
- Records after the stable cursor are returned in insertion order; unknown/stale cursors replay retained records from the beginning.
- `subscribeWithCursor({ afterId })` / `reconcile({ afterId })` / `reconcile_unacked=true` overlays retained unacknowledged records at or before the cursor, so cursor advancement alone cannot hide an unreceipted terminal notification.
- Manual `acknowledge(id, receipt)` calls are per stable event id. A later reconcile at the saved cursor replays only retained records that still lack receipt-confirmed ack evidence; already acked ids are not replayed, and no response should contain the same id twice.
- Once every id at/before the cursor is receipt-confirmed, reconciling that cursor returns no old records. The cursor remains stable instead of moving backward, preventing notifier ACK/replay loops from generating duplicate Telegram/operator pushes.
- Retained outbox records are included in broker state version 8 snapshots as `terminalOutbox`, so replay cursors, acknowledgements, and dedupe IDs survive JSON/SQLite snapshot restart.
- `POST /a2a/tasks/terminal-outbox/receipt` records non-ACK receipt progress such as `{ "status": "provider_sent" }` or `{ "status": "provider_accepted" }`, timeouts, staleness, or failures without implying current-session/operator visibility.
- `acknowledge(id, receipt)` stores receipt metadata in `ack`, updates the separate `receipt` projection, increments attempts, removes legacy `deliveredAt`, and leaves the record replayable until retention evicts it. `current_session_visible` maps to `receipt.status=current_session_visible`; `operator_visible` / `operator_confirmed` map to `receipt.status=operator_visible`. Legacy snapshots may still contain historical `provider_delivery_receipt` ACK evidence, but new ACK requests must use current-session-visible or operator-visible evidence.
- Older snapshots with `deliveredAt` but no `ack` are migrated to receipt-confirmed ack state on restore.
- Duplicate enqueue of the same terminal task state returns the retained record or is suppressed if recently seen.
- Retention is bounded by `maxTerminalTaskOutboxEvents` (default `1000`), evicting oldest records FIFO.

## Noise exclusion

Only terminal task lifecycle transitions (`task.succeeded`, `task.failed`, `task.canceled`) enter the outbox. `worker.heartbeat`, `task.heartbeat`, approval-blocked task creation, and other non-terminal audit noise are excluded.

## Release evidence integration

The `GET /release/evidence` route includes the terminal-outbox backlog risk assessment whenever the broker runs on SQLite (diagnostics available). See [release-evidence-export.md](release-evidence-export.md) for the response contract. The integrated view lets operators inspect PR/issue closeout evidence and terminal-outbox health in a single snapshot before proceeding with release closeout.
