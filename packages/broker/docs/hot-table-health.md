# Broker Hot-Table Health: RCA and Mitigation Guide

**Issue:** [#497](https://github.com/jinwon-int/a2a-broker/issues/497)
**Date:** 2026-05-12

## 1. Root Cause Analysis

### 1.1 Architecture

The SQLite broker persistence layer supports two load modes via `SqliteBrokerStateStore`:

- **`loadSource: "snapshot"`** — Reads a single canonical snapshot row from `broker_snapshots` (one JSON blob), then hydrates hot entity tables from it. The snapshot JSON is the single large in-memory object.

- **`loadSource: "hot-tables"`** — Reconstructs the runtime `BrokerSnapshot` from SQLite hot entity tables. Current code hydrates active tasks plus a capped window of terminal tasks, audit rows, and terminal outbox rows; the full rows remain queryable from SQLite hot-table read APIs.

### 1.2 Memory Pressure Vector

Historically, the `readHotRuntimeSnapshot()` method (in `src/core/store.ts`) performed unbounded `SELECT payload FROM ...` queries across the hot tables. The current runtime load path keeps active state hydrated and caps the largest historical streams:

| Table | Observed Count (seoseo) | Approx. per-row payload |
|---|---|---|
| `broker_tasks` | 660 | 100–120 KB |
| `broker_audit_events` | 1,986 | ~1 KB |
| `broker_terminal_outbox` | 389 | ~2 KB |
| `broker_tombstones` | 177 | ~1 KB |
| `broker_workers` | 21 | ~1 KB |
| `broker_exchanges` | 15 | ~2 KB |
| `broker_exchange_messages` | 31 | ~2 KB |
| `broker_proposals` | 13 | ~3 KB |
| `broker_artifacts` | 0 | — |
| `broker_validations` | 0 | — |

**Estimated pre-cap in-memory snapshot:** 660 × 110 KB ≈ **72 MB** for tasks alone, plus audit events (~2 MB), outbox (~0.8 MB), etc. Total: ~75 MB for the hot-table loaded snapshot. Runtime caps now expose how many rows hydrate vs. remain SQLite-only so operators can see when historical rows are intentionally skipped from live heap.

This is not inherently fatal, but:

1. **Every broker save** calls `writeHotEntityTables()` which writes ALL hot entities, then on the next load path, re-reads everything. This creates a sawtooth memory pattern.

2. **The canonical snapshot JSON** is also loaded by `readHotEntityMirrorStatus()` for diffing — duplicating the in-memory representation.

3. **Node.js heap OOM** was observed at ~3.5 GB (of 22.9 GB total). The broker itself loads ~75 MB, but GC pressure from repeated hot-table materialization, combined with:
   - Co-located OpenClaw Gateway memory
   - SQLite WAL accumulation (44 MB WAL file)
   - Retained request/worker state

   ...pushes the heap toward the default ~4 GB limit.

### 1.3 Health Latency Contributors

The `/health` endpoint (in `src/server.ts`) calls:

1. `stateStore.getPersistenceInfo()` → `readHotEntityMirrorStatus()` — loads full snapshot, diffs against all 10 tables (**O(n) in snapshot size**)
2. `readHotAuditDiagnostics()` — runs 3 COUNT queries + ratio computation
3. `readHotEntityDiagnostics()` — scans `broker_workers` for invalid rows

The `HealthDiagnosticsCache` (5-second TTL) prevents per-request churn, but the initial miss latency is dominated by `readHotEntityMirrorStatus()`.

### 1.4 p95/p99 Regression Risk

As table sizes grow linearly with broker usage:

| Scale | Tasks | Est. Hot-Snapshot | Est. Mirror-Status Time | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Current | 660 | ~75 MB | ~50 ms | Low (cached) |
| 2× | 1,320 | ~150 MB | ~100 ms | Medium |
| 10× | 6,600 | ~750 MB | ~500 ms | **High — OOM risk** |
| 100× | 66,000 | ~7.5 GB | ~5 s | **Critical — guaranteed OOM** |

The p95 health latency is already elevated by mirror-status comparison. At 10× scale, p99 latency exceeds 500 ms and the heap approaches exhaustion.

## 2. Mitigation Recommendations

### 2.1 Already in Place

- **`HealthDiagnosticsCache`** (5s TTL) — prevents per-request DB churn for `/health`
- **`SqliteAuditRuntimeRepository`** — limits audit events to `maxHotAuditEvents` (default 5,000) on each append via `pruneHotAuditEventsToMax()`
- **SQLite hot runtime hydration caps** — active tasks always hydrate, while terminal tasks, audit events, and terminal outbox events use configurable runtime caps (defaults: 2,000 terminal tasks, 5,000 audit events, 1,000 terminal outbox events)
- **`SqliteTaskHotRetentionPlanOptions`** — retention planning framework exists for tasks, audit events, and workers

### 2.2 Low-Risk Immediately Available

1. **Enable audit retention** — Set `maxAuditEvents` in the broker retention policy. The default is 5,000 but the seoseo broker likely has this at default. Lower to 2,000 to reduce hot-table load.

2. **Monitor hot-table counts and runtime caps** — Use `persistence.hotTableLoadMetrics` and `persistence.hotTableRuntimeLoadLimits` on `/health` to track per-table growth, unacked terminal outbox rows, and rows skipped from live heap hydration.

3. **Compact WAL** — SQLite auto-checkpoint triggers at 1,000 pages. Consider `PRAGMA wal_autocheckpoint=100` (non-breaking, affects only new transactions).

4. **Cap non-terminal task hot-table loading** — Added `BROKER_HOT_RUNTIME_MAX_NON_TERMINAL_TASKS` (default 500) to bound non-terminal task rows loaded into heap. Previously, ALL non-terminal tasks were loaded without any limit, creating an unbounded memory growth vector. (#514)

5. **Wire hot-table limits from env** — `SqliteBrokerStateStore` hot-runtime limits (`maxHotRuntimeNonTerminalTasks`, `maxHotRuntimeTerminalTasks`, `maxHotRuntimeAuditEvents`, `maxHotRuntimeTerminalOutboxEvents`) are now configurable through env vars and passed through `createDefaultStateStore()`. Previously, the broker always used hardcoded defaults regardless of environment configuration. (#514)

6. **Heap pressure readiness degradation** — `/health` now exposes `runtimeMemory.heapUsedRatio` and `runtimeMemory.eventLoopDelayMs`. When `heapUsedRatio > 0.85`, health returns `ok: false` with an error; when `heapUsedRatio > 0.70`, it adds a warning. This gives operators early visibility before OOM. (#514)

7. **Terminal outbox unacked diagnostics** — Added `terminalOutboxDiagnostics` to `/health` reporting total/acked/unacked counts, oldest unacked staleness, and staleness warnings (>7 days). This catches stalled provider delivery before outbox accumulation contributes to heap pressure. (#514)

8. **Operational env vars** (new):
   - `BROKER_HOT_RUNTIME_MAX_NON_TERMINAL_TASKS` (default: 500)
   - `BROKER_HOT_RUNTIME_MAX_TERMINAL_TASKS` (default: 2000)
   - `BROKER_HOT_RUNTIME_MAX_AUDIT_EVENTS` (default: 5000)
   - `BROKER_HOT_RUNTIME_MAX_TERMINAL_OUTBOX` (default: 1000)

### 2.3 Medium-Term (Requires Design Review)

1. **Lazy hot-table loading** — Instead of loading all 10 tables at once, load only tables referenced by current operations. The `readHotRuntimeSnapshot()` is only needed at startup and on save. Individual hot reads already filter by ID.

2. **Paged/batched loading** — Add LIMIT/OFFSET to hot-table queries for large tables, loading only recent windows.

3. **Retention auto-pruning** — Run retention planning on a schedule (not just on-demand), proactively pruning old terminal tasks and audit events.

### 2.4 Long-Term

1. **Separate SQLite from Gateway** — Run the broker on a dedicated instance to avoid co-located memory pressure.
2. **Streaming JSON snapshot** — Instead of loading the full canonical snapshot into memory for mirror status, stream-compare.

Runtime cap environment variables:

- `BROKER_HOT_RUNTIME_MAX_TERMINAL_TASKS` — completed/failed/canceled task rows hydrated at startup; active rows always hydrate.
- `BROKER_HOT_RUNTIME_MAX_AUDIT_EVENTS` — audit rows hydrated at startup.
- `BROKER_HOT_RUNTIME_MAX_TERMINAL_OUTBOX_EVENTS` — terminal outbox rows hydrated at startup.

### 3.2 Alert Thresholds

| Metric | Warning | Critical |
|---|---|---|
| `broker_tasks.count` | > 1,000 | > 5,000 |
| `broker_terminal_outbox.unackedCount` | > 100 | > 500 |
| `broker_audit_events.count` | >= 80% of `maxAuditEvents` cap and below the row critical threshold (default 4,000-4,999) | >= single-table critical row threshold (`DEFAULT_SINGLE_TABLE_CRITICAL_ROWS`, default 5,000) |
| `/health` total duration | > 200 ms | > 1,000 ms |

### 3.3 Audit Warning Semantics

The `broker_audit_events` table uses a runtime-cap ring-buffer retention model:

- **Self-pruning:** `SqliteAuditRuntimeRepository.appendAuditEvent()` prunes to
  `maxHotAuditEvents` (default 5,000) after every append via
  `pruneHotAuditEventsToMax()`. The table oscillates around the cap — new events
  push out the oldest.
- **Warning band at 80% of cap:** The health projection uses
  `DEFAULT_AUDIT_RUNTIME_LIMIT_WARNING_RATIO` (0.8, see
  `src/core/hot-table-growth.ts`). With the default 5,000 cap, this fires at
  **4,000 rows**, not at the generic 1,000-row table threshold.
- **Not critical by count alone at steady state:** The severity classifier
  (`computeTableSeverity` in `src/core/hot-table-growth.ts`) does **not**
  classify `broker_audit_events` as `critical` solely because it reached the
  generic `DEFAULT_SINGLE_TABLE_CRITICAL_ROWS` threshold (5,000). An actual
  pressure signal must be present: memory exceeding the critical threshold,
  a critical skipped-hydration ratio, unbounded growth (growth rate > 50%),
  or the row count materially exceeding the runtime cap (>20% overshoot).
  Without those signals, the table is classified as `warning` at or near the
  cap, informing operators without forcing `/health.ok: false`.
- **Persistent by design:** Once the table reaches its operating cap, the audit
  warning signal can persist — the table is designed to hover at the cap
  boundary. This is **informational**, not a live cleanup trigger, when all
  of the following hold:

  | Condition | Check |
  |---|---|
  | Memory not pressured | Verify `hotTableGrowth.readinessDegradation.memoryPressure: false`, `heapPressure: false`, and no per-table memory critical other than the audit row-count threshold |
  | No skipped hydration | `runtimeSkipped: 0` on `broker_audit_events` in `/health` |
  | `auditDiagnostics` warnings empty | `auditDiagnostics.warnings: []` in `/health` |
  | Terminal outbox unacked count low | `persistence.hotTableLoadMetrics.tables.broker_terminal_outbox.unackedCount` near 0 |

  If those conditions hold, no immediate prune or restart is needed.
  The warning signal allows operators to see the retained audit volume
  without triggering a false `critical` / `ok: false` health state.
