# Team1 public-readiness final closeout matrix

Issue: [#440](https://github.com/jinwon-int/a2a-broker/issues/440)
Parent roadmap: [#294](https://github.com/jinwon-int/a2a-broker/issues/294)
Related parent: [a2a-plane#75](https://github.com/jinwon-int/a2a-plane/issues/75)
External gate: [openclaw/openclaw#78261](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/78261)

This is a read-only closeout validation snapshot for the Team1 libero lane. It records the GitHub state checked during the final public-readiness closeout pass. No production deploy, Gateway/broker/worker restart, production DB mutation, live provider/Telegram send, terminal-outbox ACK, or maintainer action on the external OpenClaw PR was performed.

## 2026-05-09 next-round revalidation after `openclaw/openclaw#78261` became conflicted/dirty

This update revalidates the next Team1 round after the external upstream dependency changed shape from merely open/unrolled to `mergeable=CONFLICTING` and `mergeStateStatus=DIRTY`. The verification was GitHub read-only only; no upstream maintainer action was taken.

| Item | Live state verified | Closeout recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `a2a-plane#99` | `MERGED` at `2026-05-09T07:03:07Z`; merge commit `9ac822848bdea59e0923f6905aea4445637b1fe6`; compare to `main` is `identical`; CI `check` passed. Source issue `a2a-plane#98` is `CLOSED`. | Already merged this round; no further plane merge is blocked by Team1 lane state. |
| `openclaw-plugin-a2a#239` | `MERGED` at `2026-05-09T07:02:28Z`; merge commit `0bdcf64e1640a976393e2fa51ffd7a95f4ed5c3b`; compare to `main` is `identical`; CI `build` checks passed. Source issue `openclaw-plugin-a2a#238` is `CLOSED`. | Already merged this round. |
| `a2a-broker#441` | `MERGED` at `2026-05-09T07:02:32Z`; merge commit `2803f36b1bdd9093e31f2bb434aa8cb6fdacbed9`; compare to `main` is `ahead` with `behind_by=0` because `#442` followed it; CI `build` checks passed. Source issue `a2a-broker#440` is `CLOSED`. | Already merged this round. |
| `a2a-broker#442` | `MERGED` at `2026-05-09T07:02:37Z`; merge commit `4d6c3c1c460d86c8e2068f58f36e9c9dd307ee97`; compare to `main` is `identical`; CI `build` checks passed. Source issue `a2a-broker#439` is `CLOSED`. | Already merged this round. |
| `openclaw/openclaw#78261` | `OPEN`, `mergedAt=null`, head `307cc712a61f1cdbdfea39acc6286c987ba049a2`; `gh pr view` reports `mergeable=CONFLICTING`, `mergeStateStatus=DIRTY`; labels are `docs`, `channel: bluebubbles`, `channel: telegram`, `size: M`, `proof: supplied`, `proof: sufficient`; current checks have no failing required result observed, but mergeability is blocked by conflicts. | External blocker remains; do not close #75/#294 or start runtime rollout until upstream conflict is resolved, merged, and rollout proof is recorded. |

### Current closeout matrix for `#75` / `#294`

| Parent | What can be merged this round | What must remain open | Exact blocker labels / keys |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `a2a-plane#75` | No additional Team1 round PR is waiting: `#99` is merged and `#98` is closed. | Keep parent open and public-readiness NO-GO. | Existing repo labels to apply/keep: `a2a-public`, `blocker`, `operator-decision`, `no-go-public`. Blocker keys: `upstream-conflicted-dirty`, `upstream-runtime-rollout-missing`, `external-scanner-evidence-pending`, `operator-approval-required`. |
| `a2a-broker#294` | No additional broker Team1 round PR is waiting: `#441` and `#442` are merged and `#439/#440` are closed. | Keep roadmap open. | Existing repo labels to apply/keep: `a2a-public`, `a2a-public-readiness`, `blocker`. Blocker keys: `upstream-conflicted-dirty`, `upstream-runtime-rollout-missing`, `external-scanner-evidence-pending`, `operator-approval-required`. |

### Scanner evidence: deterministic repo-local vs. external

The closeout matrix distinguishes two scanner evidence layers:

| Layer | Source | Deterministic? | Required? | Evidence
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Repo-local** | `scripts/public-readiness-scan.mjs` + `scripts/public-readiness-scan.test.mjs` (39 tests) | ✅ Yes — single Node.js script, versioned in-repo, no external deps, stable JSON output diffable across commits | ✅ Required for every public-readiness check | `npm run scan:public-readiness` (0 fail, 29 warn at this snapshot); 39/39 tests pass |
| **External** | `gitleaks` / `trufflehog` (if operator-approved) | ❌ No — depends on external binary versions and per-tool config; output is not commit-reproducible | ❌ Not required per `docs/scanner-coverage-vs-gitleaks-trufflehog.md` decision | Run only on explicit operator request; the repo-local scanner is the sole deterministic gate |

The blocker key `external-scanner-evidence-pending` in the closeout matrix above refers to the **supplementary external layer** (not required, per scanner coverage decision). The **deterministic repo-local scanner evidence** is complete and passing.

### Worker-lane/live-state contradictions flagged

- The older “New-round merge decision” table below is now historical: it recorded `a2a-plane#98`, `openclaw-plugin-a2a#238`, `a2a-broker#439`, and `a2a-broker#440` as open Start-only issues. Live GitHub now shows those issues closed and their follow-on PRs (`#99`, `#239`, `#442`, `#441`) merged.
- Previous closeout text described `openclaw/openclaw#78261` as open/unrolled with failing or in-progress checks observed at that time. Live state now shows checks green/skipped/neutral, but the PR is still not mergeable because it is `CONFLICTING`/`DIRTY`; the blocker has changed shape, not cleared.
- Both parent issues currently have no labels applied in live GitHub, despite the matrix requiring blocker/public-readiness labels while they remain NO-GO.

| `a2a-plane#96` | Source lane issue is `CLOSED`; PR link points to `a2a-plane#97`. | `gh issue view 96 --repo jinwon-int/a2a-plane`. | Closed out. |
| `openclaw-plugin-a2a#237` | PR is `CLOSED` and not merged by design; CI `build` checks succeeded; it only carried an evidence artifact. | `gh pr view 237 --repo jinwon-int/openclaw-plugin-a2a`; linked issue comment states the PR was intentionally closed unmerged because no plugin code/docs change was needed after `#235`. | Closed out with accepted Done evidence, no merge needed. |
| `openclaw-plugin-a2a#236` | Source lane issue is `CLOSED`; Done evidence accepts the intentional unmerged `#237` outcome and records existing receipt-boundary tests/docs as sufficient. | `gh issue view 236 --repo jinwon-int/openclaw-plugin-a2a`. | Closed out. |
| `a2a-broker#437` | PR is `MERGED`; merged at `2026-05-09T06:16:14Z`; merge commit `07fc9eed78717f5848b1070d22a20b94df03942f` is contained in `main`; CI `build` checks succeeded. | `gh pr view 437 --repo jinwon-int/a2a-broker`; compare from merge commit to `main` returned `behind_by=0`. | Closed out. |
| `a2a-broker#436` | Source lane issue is `CLOSED`; PR link points to `a2a-broker#437`. | `gh issue view 436 --repo jinwon-int/a2a-broker`. | Closed out. |
| `a2a-broker#438` | PR is `MERGED`; merged at `2026-05-09T06:16:19Z`; merge commit `18737753cbad21ff695fb6d547fc08acda754dbd` is identical to `main`; CI `build` checks succeeded. | `gh pr view 438 --repo jinwon-int/a2a-broker`; compare from merge commit to `main` returned `status=identical`. | Closed out. |
| `a2a-broker#435` | Source lane issue is `CLOSED`; PR link points to `a2a-broker#438`. | `gh issue view 435 --repo jinwon-int/a2a-broker`. | Closed out. |
| `openclaw/openclaw#78261` | External upstream PR remains `OPEN`; current check rollup is passing/skipped with no failing check reported by `gh pr checks`; it has not been merged or rolled out. | `gh pr view 78261 --repo openclaw/openclaw`; `gh pr checks 78261 --repo openclaw/openclaw`. | External blocker remains. |

## Historical new-round merge decision from the earlier snapshot

At the earlier validation pass, no new candidate PR was available to merge. The subsequently opened lane tickets were issues, not PRs, and each only had a Start marker at that verification time. This section is retained as historical evidence; the current live-state revalidation above supersedes it:

| Lane ticket | State at verification | Merge decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `a2a-plane#98` | `OPEN` issue; no PR resolved for number `98`; only Start evidence present. | No merge candidate. |
| `openclaw-plugin-a2a#238` | `OPEN` issue; no PR resolved for number `238`; only Start evidence present. | No merge candidate. |
| `a2a-broker#439` | `OPEN` issue; no PR resolved for number `439`; only Start evidence present. | No merge candidate. |
| `a2a-broker#440` | `OPEN` issue for this libero matrix; no PR existed before this docs-only evidence patch. | No merge candidate yet. |

Recommendation: stay **NO-GO** for public-readiness publication/visibility changes. Do not merge a new functional PR solely to advance public readiness until the external upstream gate and operator approval blockers are resolved.

## Parent closeout recommendation

| Parent | Recommendation | Exact blocker |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `a2a-plane#75` | Keep open. | `openclaw/openclaw#78261` is still open/unrolled; external scanner/public-readiness evidence for the new round is still pending; explicit operator approval is still required before visibility/publication changes. |
| `a2a-broker#294` | Keep open. | Same blockers: upstream OpenClaw PR not merged/rolled out, final external scanner evidence not complete for the new round, and no explicit operator approval for public-readiness publication. |

The prior listed Team1 closeout lanes are complete, but the overall roadmap should remain open and NO-GO until those blockers clear.
